Matlab implementation of the [C-space approach to tool-path generation for die and mould machining](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010448597000122).
 
Assignment for [ME290D](http://www.me.berkeley.edu/~mcmains/290D/).

There was an in class contest for the fastest inverse tool offset generator. Me and my partner won by an order of magnitude by rewriting the majority of calculations as matrix math.
