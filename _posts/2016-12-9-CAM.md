Matlab implementation of the [C-space approach to tool-path generation for die and mould machining](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010448597000122).
 
Assignment for [ME290D](http://www.me.berkeley.edu/~mcmains/290D/).

Plot of the inverse tool offset surface and the inclination in the X axis.

Milled out of machinable wax.




There was a contest in class for fastest inverse tool offset generator. Me and my partner won by an order of magnitude by rewriting the majority of calculations as matrix math.
