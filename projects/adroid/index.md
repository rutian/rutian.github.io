_Adroid_ enables users to borrow precision and accuracy from a robotic arm when using hand-held tools. When a tool is mounted to the robot, the user can hold and move the tool directly --- _Adroid_ measures the user's applied forces and commands the robot to move in response. Depending on the tool and scenario, _Adroid_ can selectively restrict certain motions. In the resulting interaction, the robot acts like a virtual "jig" which constrains the toolâ€™s motion; augmenting the user's accuracy, technique, and strength, while not diminishing their agency during open-ended fabrication tasks. We complement these hands-on interactions with projected augmented reality for visual feedback about the state of the system. We show how tools augmented by Adroid can support hands-on making and discuss how it can be configured to support other tasks within and beyond fabrication.
